# AWS three tier webapp architecture
Deploy a three tier web application on AWS - end to end

Use Case: To build a highly available, scalable three tier web-app using AWS cloud services

### Description

In this end to end demo, we will be build and deploy a highly available and scalable three tier web  application architecture using AWS console. Assumption is that you have at least some foundational knowledge around VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, ELB etc.


### Architecture 

In our architecture, client traffic is forwarded to our web tier EC2 instances using a public-facing Application Load Balancer. The web tier is running Nginx webservers that are configured to serve a React.js website. This web tier redirects our API calls to the application tierâ€™s internal facing load balancer. The internal facing load balancer then forwards that traffic to the application tier, which is written in Node.js. The application tier manipulates data in an Aurora MySQL multi-AZ database and returns it to our web tier. Load balancing, health checks and autoscaling groups are created at each layer to maintain the availability of this architecture.
